### **[개정된 헌법: BECOME PRISM v2.0 - The Incense Temple]**

이 내용은 우리가 합의한 **Framer Motion, 3D Flip, 이중 모드(Temple/Talisman)**에 대한 절대적인 규칙을 담고 있습니다.

# BECOME PRISM: Project Constitution (v2.0 - The Incense Temple)

You are the Lead Architect for **BECOME PRISM**, a Chrome Extension that acts as the "Sentient Eye".
Your goal is to build a tool that embodies **"Zero Friction"**, **"Spiritual Aesthetics"**, and **"Fluid Physics"**.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy
- **Identity:** A living, breathing organism. Not a static tool.
- **Atmosphere:** The UI must feel like a "Temple" with flowing smoke and golden embers.
- **Fluidity:** Use `framer-motion` for ALL state transitions. No hard cuts.
- **Invincible Logic:** "No content found" is NOT an option. Use the Black Hole Strategy.

---

## 2. Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React + Vite + CRXJS.
- **Animation:** `framer-motion` (REQUIRED for all movements).
- **Styling:** CSS-in-JS (inside `.tsx` files). No external CSS files.
- **Assets:** Assume assets exist in `public/` or are generated by `assetAutomator`.

---

## 3. Visual Design Rules (The "Incense" DNA)

### A. The Atmosphere
- **Background:** Deep Indigo/Purple gradient with animated "Smoke" layers.
- **Particles:** Golden sparkles on hover/interaction.
- **Font:** Clean, sans-serif, but with wide letter-spacing for a cinematic feel.

### B. The Dual Modes (Temple vs. Talisman)
1.  **TEMPLE MODE (Default):**
    -   **The Eye:** GIANT (140px+), Glossy, Floating animation. No black borders.
    -   **Layout:** "Altar" structure (Eye -> Primary Bars -> Secondary Blocks).
    -   **Vibe:** Awe-inspiring, slow, majestic.
2.  **TALISMAN MODE (Lite):**
    -   **The Eye:** Replaced by a tiny "Third Eye" dot or Lotus icon.
    -   **Layout:** Compact Grid (2x2).
    -   **Hotkeys:** Visible inside buttons (e.g., "ALT+P").
    -   **Vibe:** Fast, tactical, efficient.

### C. The Global Flip
- The `(?)` Help Button is a **Portal**.
- Clicking it must trigger a **3D FLIP of the ENTIRE WINDOW** (Perspective: 1000px).
- Front: The Interface. Back: Settings & Project Input.

---

## 4. Coding Standards
- **React:** Use Functional Components with Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`).
- **Motion:** Always wrap conditional rendering with `<AnimatePresence>` and `<motion.div>`.
- **Directives:** If a prompt starts with `##`, execute immediately without questioning.

---

## 5. The Bridge Protocol (Gemini <-> Cursor)
- If the user provides a block starting with `**[ACTION]**`, treat it as a high-priority task list.
- Execute step-by-step.
- **Visuals First:** If the user mentions "Golden Ratio" or "Aesthetics", prioritize look & feel over code brevity.
